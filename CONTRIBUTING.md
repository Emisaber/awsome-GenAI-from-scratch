## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This repo aims to collect interesting Generative AI(GenAI) projects that are easy to get started with.  
And the main idea behind this awesome list is **"understanding GenAI by build a demo from sratch"**.  

For beginners(like myself), it can be challenging to directly follow the projects' tutorial due to limited background knowledge. To help with that, this repo also maintains some high-quality blogs and influential materials that could benefit newcomers.
